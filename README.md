We have built a python project which is used to store key-values and data in some location in laptop.Which supports create,read,modify and delete operations.Which also supports Time-To-Live property. Where in create operation, can add new key-value.The key is always string(32char).  Read operation can be performed by providing the key and receiving the value in response. In modify opertaion we can modify key-value. Delete operation will delete the key which have mentioned. In Time-To-Live property,it will be evaluated as an integer defining the number of seconds the key must be retained in data store.Once it is expired the key will no longer be available. The error will be returned if the data exceeded. The size of file to store is 1GB it willl never exceed 1GB.
